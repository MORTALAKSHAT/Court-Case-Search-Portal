# 🧾 Court Data Fetcher & Mini Dashboard (Internship Task 1)

This project scrapes case or judgment data from a sample website (or a real Indian court portal) and displays it in a Streamlit dashboard. The dashboard allows filtering, searching, and downloading the data in CSV format.

## ✅ Features

- 📊 Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- 🔎 Search/filter cases by case number
- 📁 Download results as CSV
- 🔐 Replace sample site with real eCourts or High Court portal
- ⚠️ **Note:** Due to inconsistent access and timeout issues on eCourts public portals, this project uses **realistic dummy case data** for demonstration purposes. You can later extend it to scrape real court websites using Selenium or APIs if available.
